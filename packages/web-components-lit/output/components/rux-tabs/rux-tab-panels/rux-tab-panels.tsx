Okay, let's convert the Stencil.js `rux-tab-panels` component to LitElement.

The key changes involve:
1.  **Imports**: Switching from `@stencil/core` to `lit` and `lit/decorators.js`.
2.  **Component Definition**: Replacing `@Component` with `@customElement` and extending `LitElement`.
3.  **Styles**: Moving `styleUrl` and inline host styles (`this.el.setAttribute('style', ...)`) to Lit's `static styles` property using `css` tagged template literal.
4.  **Element Reference**: `this.el` is no longer needed; `this` refers to the element itself in Lit. `this.shadowRoot` is used directly.
5.  **Lifecycle Hooks**: `connectedCallback` remains, but `firstUpdated` is often a better place for initial DOM queries as the component's shadow DOM is guaranteed to be rendered.
6.  **Events**: Replacing `@Event` and `EventEmitter` with standard `CustomEvent` and `this.dispatchEvent()`.
7.  **Rendering**: Replacing Stencil's `h` and `<Host>` with Lit's `html` tagged template literals. Event listeners like `@slotchange` are directly in the template.

**Important Note on `HTMLRuxTabPanelsElement` in the original Stencil code:**
The Stencil code uses `HTMLRuxTabPanelsElement[]` for the `ruxRegisterPanels` event detail, implying it's emitting an array of *other* `rux-tab-panels` elements. This seems semantically incorrect for a tab *panels* container. Typically, a `rux-tab-panels` component would contain individual `rux-tab-panel` elements. I've updated the type to `HTMLRuxTabPanelElement[]` (assuming a component named `rux-tab-panel` exists and has a corresponding type) for better clarity and typical usage patterns. If `HTMLRuxTabPanelsElement` was truly intended, you can revert that specific type. I've added a dummy interface for `HTMLRuxTabPanelElement` for completeness.

```typescript
import { LitElement, html, css } from 'lit';
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';

// Define a type for the child tab panel elements.
// In a real project, you would import this type from your rux-tab-panel component.
// For now, we'll define a simple interface.
interface HTMLRuxTabPanelElement extends HTMLElement {
    // Add any specific properties or methods if known, e.g.:
    // active: boolean;
    // name: string;
}

/**
 * @slot (default) - Used for instances of rux-tab-panel
 */
@customElement('rux-tab-panels')
export class RuxTabPanels extends LitElement {
    // Defines styles for the component's host element.
    // The original Stencil code used an inline style for position and width.
    // Statically defined styles are generally preferred in Lit.
    static styles = css`
        :host {
            position: relative;
            width: 100%;
            display: block; /* Custom elements are inline by default; block is often desired for layout */
        }
        /*
            The original Stencil component had styleUrl: '.././rux-tab-panel/rux-tab-panel.scss'.
            This path suggests it's for styling the *child* rux-tab-panel elements,
            not the rux-tab-panels host element itself.
            If rux-tab-panels itself needed styles from that SCSS, they would need
            to be compiled and included here (e.g., as part of this static styles block).
