Okay, let's convert your Stencil.js `rux-tab-panel` component to LitElement.

Here's the LitElement version:

```typescript
import { LitElement, html, css } from 'lit';
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';

/**
 * @slot (default) - Used to render any additional content inside a rux-tab-panel.
 *
 * A rux-tab-panel represents the content of a single tab within a tabbed interface.
 * It typically works in conjunction with a `rux-tabs` component and is managed
 * by a parent component (or JavaScript) that controls its visibility based on
 * the active tab.
 */
@customElement('rux-tab-panel')
export class RuxTabPanel extends LitElement {
    // Styles from your rux-tab-panel.scss would go here.
    // In Lit, you typically inline the CSS as a tagged template literal.
    // If you have a complex SCSS file, your build system would compile it
    // to CSS and then you'd paste the resulting CSS string here.
    static styles = css`
        /* Styles from rux-tab-panel.scss */
        :host {
            display: block; /* Tab panels are usually block-level elements */
            /* Add any other specific styles from your SCSS here, e.g., padding, borders */
        }

        /* Example of a common style for tab panels that should be hidden by default
           and shown when active. This assumes a parent component manages the 'hidden' attribute.
        :host([hidden]) {
            display: none;
        }
        */
    `;

    /**
     * LitElement's connectedCallback is called when the element is inserted into the DOM.
     * This is where you'd set initial attributes or perform other setup.
     */
    connectedCallback() {
        super.connectedCallback(); // Always call super.connectedCallback()

        // In Stencil, you used @Element() el! and then el.setAttribute.
        // In Lit, `this` inside the class *is* the host element, so you can
        // directly call setAttribute on `this`.
        this.setAttribute('role', 'tabpanel');
    }

    /**
     * LitElement's render method defines the component's internal Shadow DOM structure.
     * Stencil's <Host> is implicit in Lit; the content returned by `render()` is
     * automatically placed inside the component's shadow root.
     */
    render() {
        return html`<slot></slot>`;
    }
}
```

### Key Changes and Explanations:

1.  **Imports:**
    *   `import { Component, Host, h, Element } from '@stencil/core'` becomes `import { LitElement, html, css } from 'lit';` and `import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';`.
    *   `LitElement`: The base class for all Lit components.
    *   `html`: A tagged template literal function used to define the component's template.
    *   `css`: A tagged template literal function used to define the component's styles.
    *   `customElement`: A decorator from `lit/decorators.js` to register your custom element.

2.  **Component Definition:**
    *   The `@Component` decorator is replaced by extending `LitElement` and using the `@customElement` decorator:
        ```typescript
        @customElement('rux-tab-panel')
        export class RuxTabPanel extends LitElement { /* ... */ }
        ```
    *   The `tag` property from Stencil's `@Component` is now the argument to `@customElement`.

3.  **Styling (`styleUrl` to `static styles`):**
    *   Stencil's `styleUrl: 'rux-tab-panel.scss'` is replaced by a `static styles` property.
    *   In Lit, styles are defined as tagged template literals using the `css` function. You typically paste the compiled CSS directly into this block. If you're using a build system (like Rollup, Vite, Webpack), you would configure it to import `.scss` files and convert them into a JavaScript string that can be used here.
    *   `display: block;` is a common default for tab panels, which typically occupy a block of space.

4.  **Element Reference (`@Element()`):**
    *   The `@Element() el!: HTMLRuxTabPanelElement` property is no longer needed for this use case.
    *   In Lit (and standard Web Components), `this` within the component class refers to the host custom element itself. So, to set an attribute on the host element, you simply use `this.setAttribute('role', 'tabpanel')`.

5.  **Lifecycle Hooks (`connectedCallback`):**
    *   `connectedCallback()` works the same way in Lit as in Stencil. It's called when the element is added to the DOM.
    *   **Important:** Always call `super.connectedCallback()` when overriding lifecycle methods in LitElement to ensure the base class's logic is executed.

6.  **Rendering (`render()` and `Host`):**
    *   Stencil's `render() { return (<Host><slot></slot></Host>) }` becomes `render() { return html`<slot></slot>`; }`.
    *   The `h` function (hyperscript) and JSX syntax are replaced by Lit's `html` tagged template literal.
    *   The `<Host>` component in Stencil, which applies content/attributes to the host element, is implicit in Lit. Whatever you return from Lit's `render()` method is rendered directly into the component's Shadow DOM. The `<slot></slot>` works identically in both.

This LitElement version provides the same functionality as your Stencil component while adhering to Lit's conventions.
