To convert your Stencil.js test to LitElement, we'll primarily replace Stencil's testing utilities with `@open-wc/testing`'s `fixture` and `html` template literal.

Here's the converted test file:

```typescript
// Assuming you have installed @open-wc/testing:
// npm install --save-dev @open-wc/testing @web/test-runner-jest @types/jest

import { fixture, html } from '@open-wc/testing';
import { RuxTreeNode } from './rux-tree-node'; // Make sure this path points to your LitElement version of RuxTreeNode

describe('RuxTreeNode', () => {
    let element: RuxTreeNode; // Declare a variable to hold the LitElement instance
    const buttonSpy = jest.fn();

    beforeEach(async () => {
        // Clear any previous calls to the spy before each test
        buttonSpy.mockClear();

        // Use @open-wc/testing's fixture to create and append the element to the DOM.
        // It also waits for the element's first update cycle to complete.
        // The @eventname syntax is how Lit/lit-html listens for custom events.
        element = await fixture<RuxTreeNode>(html`
            <rux-tree-node
                @ruxtreenodeselected=${(ev: CustomEvent) => buttonSpy(ev)}
            ></rux-tree-node>
        `);
    });

    it('Should emit on click', async () => {
        // 'element' already holds the reference to your 'rux-tree-node' instance.
        // No need for querySelector as we have a direct reference.
        
        // Simulate a click on the component.
        element.click();

        // Assertions remain largely the same as Jest is agnostic to the UI framework.
        expect(buttonSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
        // [0][0] - first argument of the first call (which is the CustomEvent)
        expect(buttonSpy.mock.calls[0][0].detail).toEqual('node-1');

        // If your click action caused the component to re-render and you needed
        // to assert something about the updated DOM, you would use:
        // await element.updateComplete;
        // However, for testing event emission, it's usually not necessary as the event
        // is dispatched synchronously with the click.
    });
});
```

**Key Changes Explained:**

1.  **Imports:**
    *   Removed Stencil-specific imports (`h`, `newSpecPage`, `SpecPage`).
    *   Added `@open-wc/testing` imports: `fixture` (for creating and appending elements) and `html` (for defining templates in a Lit-compatible way).
    *   The `RuxTreeNode` import path should now point to your LitElement version of the component.

2.  **Test Setup (`beforeEach`):**
    *   `page: SpecPage` is replaced with `element: RuxTreeNode`. You get a direct reference to your component instance.
    *   `newSpecPage` is replaced by `await fixture(...)`.
    *   The JSX template (`<rux-tree-node ...>`) is replaced with an `html` tagged template literal: `html`<rux-tree-node ...></rux-tree-node>``.
    *   Event Listener: Stencil's `onRuxtreenodeselected` prop syntax is converted to Lit's event listener syntax using `@`: `@ruxtreenodeselected=${(ev: CustomEvent) => buttonSpy(ev)}`.

3.  **Test Logic (`it` block):**
    *   Instead of `page.doc?.querySelector('rux-tree-node')`, you directly use the `element` variable obtained from the `fixture` call in `beforeEach`.
    *   `page.waitForChanges()` is not needed. `fixture` automatically waits for the element to complete its first update. For subsequent updates triggered by user interaction (like a click), you would typically use `await element.updateComplete;` *if* you needed to assert on the component's re-rendered state. For simply verifying an event was dispatched, it's not required as event dispatch is synchronous.
    *   The `element.click()` and Jest `expect` calls remain the same, as they are standard browser APIs and Jest assertions.

This converted test assumes your `RuxTreeNode` LitElement component correctly dispatches a `CustomEvent` named `ruxtreenodeselected` with the `detail: 'node-1'`.
