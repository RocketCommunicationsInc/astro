# Sample App

## Putting It Together

The Sample [Astro App](https://sample-app.astrouxds.com/) is provided to make it easier to create an application by combining components from Astro.

We've created an example for you that combines visual design, navigation, asset selection, data visualization, and other components to illustrate common layouts that are possible with the Astro components.

::: caution
Please note that the Sample App and web components are **NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE**. These are being provided as examples of how the UX works and a starting point for your development.
