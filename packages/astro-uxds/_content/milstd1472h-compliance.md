# MIL-STD-1472H Compliance

The Astro Space UX Design System is designed to support the development of custom space applications with established interaction patterns and best practices. To this end, Astro UXDS strives to achieve compliance with applicable DOD design standards. Astro 7 was audited to determine its level of compliance with relevant items in Section 5.17 (Information Systems) of MIL-STD-1472H, and as of September 29, 2022 this is our assessment of Astro UXDS compliance.

For the items determined to be Non-Compliant, we are looking at the level of effort to achieve compliance.

For the items determined to be Not Applicable to Astro UXDS, many times the onus is on the application developer to ensure compliance for those items is met. Astro UXDS often offers guidance or components that can help achieve compliance, but cannot do so directly.

For example, if a user would have reason to suppose that all data about a particular topic would be stored in one place, then the query language should permit such data to be retrieved by a single query, even though various pieces of data may be stored in different computer files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not Applicable            |
| 5.17.2.3.2      | Coherent representation of data organization. A single representation of the data organization for use in query formulation shall be established (i.e., the user does not need to know if different queries will access different databases via different routes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not Applicable            |
| 5.17.2.3.3      | Task-oriented wording.

As such, color coding in display design shall not be the only means of coding information for affected operational systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Compliant                 |

| 5.17.25.16.1    | Color contrast. Colored symbols shall differ from their background by not less than 100 ΔE (color difference) (CIE L*u*v*) distances when calculated using the formula below. The elements required for the calculation are the luminance (Y), the UCS coordinates (u', v') for foreground and background colors, and the maximum luminance for the display (YM). As with the (CIE L*u*v*) distances, caution should be used in assessing legibility for characters in colors having small luminance differences. This caution applies not only to characters in color but also to small luminance differences in background colors and for very small luminance differences between characters in color and background in color. Unusually large or small characters may lead to erroneous estimates of legibility. The metric is as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                | Non-Compliant             |
