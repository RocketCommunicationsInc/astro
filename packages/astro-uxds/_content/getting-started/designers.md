# Getting Started For Designers

Astro UX Design assets include files for creating Astro Application wireframes and mockups in Sketch and Adobe XD.

Before reading any further, we recommend you take a look at a live [Astro sample application](https://sample-app.astrouxds.com/) and review available Astro components on the [Astro Storybook](https://astro-components.netlify.app/?path=/story/astro-uxds-welcome--start-here) site. Examples of Astro in-use can be seen within the Astro Service [Specific Design](/service-specific-ux-design/) pages.

### How to use Astro color swatches

Astro color swatches are built into the Astro libraries and can be used once loaded. Using library color swatches helps keep your application consistent through reusable, documented fills, and styles:

### Updating/Syncing

When an update is available, the new file can be loaded into Sketch by replacing the saved Sketch library file in your file directory and then updating it within Sketch.

### Importing Sketch Files into Adobe XD

Sketch files can be imported into Adobe XD. Symbols created in a Sketch file will be imported into the assets library.

## Astro & EGS Design Compliance

The Astro team has worked with EGS to establish the EGS Design Compliance requirements for developers targeting the EGS Platform. These requirements are specific to EGS development; these requirements are based on common best practices and accessibility guidelines and it is highly recommended for all users to incorporate them into their applications.
