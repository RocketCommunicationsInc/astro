# Getting Started For Designers

Astro UX design assets include files for creating Astro application wireframes and mockups in Sketch and Adobe XD.

Before reading any further, we recommend you take a look at a live [Astro Sample Application](https://sample-app.astrouxds.com/) and review available Astro components on the [Astro Storybook](https://astro-components.netlify.app/?path=/story/astro-uxds-welcome--start-here) site. Examples of Astro in-use can be seen within the Astro Service [Specific Design](/service-specific-ux-design/) pages.

## Astro & EGS Design Compliance

The Astro team has worked with EGS to establish the EGS Design Compliance requirements for developers targeting the EGS Platform. These requirements are specific to EGS development; these requirements are based on common best practices and accessibility guidelines and it is highly recommended for all users to incorporate them into their applications.

## MIL-STD-1472 Compliance

Astro strives to achieve compliance with applicable DOD design standards. Astro 7 was audited to determine its level of compliance with relevant items in Section 5.17 (Information Systems) of [MIL-STD-1472H](https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsdocdetails.aspx?ident_number=36903), and as of September 29, 2022 this is our assessment of Astro UXDS compliance.
