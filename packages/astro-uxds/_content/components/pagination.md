# Pagination

::: note
Be sure the current page is easily distinguishable from other pages referenced by the Pagination.
:::

## Rules of Thumb

- Don’t underline links.
- Use Pagination only when necessary. Instead, think about editing the content to fit onto one page.
- Make each page a similar length.
- If there is only one page, no Pagination is needed.

## Appearance and Behavior

## Examples

:::two-col
![Offer a “Prev” and “Next” link where useful.](/img/components/pagination-1.png)

![Disable the “Prev” link when there are no more pages before the first numeral displayed.](/img/components/pagination-2.png)

![Disable the “Next” link when there are no more pages after the last numeral displayed.](/img/components/pagination-3.png)

## Pagination of Search Results

:::two-col

![Optionally, links for “Show All” and “Number of Results” may be displayed below page numbers. Links are centered below the Pagination on the same baseline.](/img/components/pagination-4.png)

![When there are no Search results, suggest that the user amend the Search.](/img/components/pagination-5.png)
