# Classification Marking

Classification and Control Markings are required for digital products created for government clients who interact with classified or controlled information.

For the most up-to-date policies, see the [ISOO Training Aids](https://www.archives.gov/isoo/training/training-aids) for classification marking policies and the [CUI Registry](https://www.archives.gov/cui) for control marking policies. In addition to these requirements, each government agency may have their own rules to use for Classification and Control Markings.

## Typescript Types

```
import { Classification } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components'
```

**Classification**

```
 type Classification =
    | 'cui'
    | 'confidential'

    | 'top-secret'
    | 'top-secret-sci'
    | 'unclassified'

## Variants

### With Label

Applying the `label` property attribute to the Classification Custom Element adds `label` text value to the marking in addition to its classification text.

### With Footer Banner

When using the Classification Marking component as a wrapper with slotted children, setting the `footerBanner` property attribute to the Classification Custom Element adds a duplicate of the Classification Banner to the bottom of parent element.

### All Tag Variants

By default Classification Markings are rendered in banner format. Applying the `tag` property attribute sets the marking type. The `tag` attribute property defines the Classification Marking as a Tag.

## Cherry Picking

If you're already utilizing a build system that supports tree shaking and want to only import this individual component:

```js
import { RuxClassificationMarking } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-classification-marking'
customElements.define('rux-classification-marking', RuxClassificationMarking)
```
