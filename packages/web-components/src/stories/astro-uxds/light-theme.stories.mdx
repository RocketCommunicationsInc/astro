# Theming

Astro supports a light theme along with the original, default dark theme.

> By convention, the Global Status Bar and its enclosed elements will always use the dark theme styling.

For usage guidelines, refer to [Astro UXDS - Theming](https://www.astrouxds.com/design-guidelines/theme/).

## Enabling the Light Theme

To enable the light theme, simply add the `light-theme` CSS class to your body element. This will apply the light theme globally.

## Mixed Use

Individual sections or components can override their inherited theme on a case-by-case basis, enabling the render of an element with a light theme in an predominantly dark-themed interface and vice versa.

You can also apply the `light-theme` class on individual components. For example:

```html
<rux-button class="light-theme">Submit</rux-button>
```
