# Core Concepts

## Shadow DOM

If you're new to using Web Components, you'll quickly notice that the traditional way of styling elements with CSS doesn't work with Astro components.

For example, this won't work:

```html
<rux-button style="background:red;">button</rux-button>
```

This is a feature of the Shadow DOM--outside styles cannot be applied to content inside the Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM gives us a clean, native way
of encapsulating styles and protects your applications from breaking changes. The Shadow DOM API provides two solutions
for customization: CSS Custom Properties and CSS Shadow Parts.

## Our Public API

All of our Astro Web Components expose a public API, similar to native HTML elements. When using our web components,
you should only interface with our public APIs or else your applications may unexpectedly break when upgrading. For example,
avoid directly manipulating anything inside of the Shadow Root.

Our public API includes the following:

* Properties/Attributes
* Slots
* Methods
* Events
* CSS Custom Properties (Styling)
* CSS Shadow Parts (Styling)

### Properties/Attributes

Properties and attributes define a component's appearance or behavior.

### Slots

Slots are placeholder sections within the Shadow DOM, allowing you full control over both the markup and styling of the content inside of it.
Each component will have all of its available slots documented under the API section. To make use of slots, use the `slot` attribute.

For example:

```html
<rux-container>
    <header slot="header">My Header</header>
    ... body content ...
</rux-container>
```

```css
header {
    background: red;
}
```

#### Default Slots

Components may also have one unnamed default slot. These do not require the use of the `slot` attribute in your markup.

For example:

```html
<rux-container>
    <div id="this-is-default-slotted-content">
        Hello World
    </div>
</rux-container>
```

```css
#this-is-default-slotted-content {
    background: red;
}
```

#### When To Use

Because slotted content is outside of the Shadow DOM, it can be styled just like any other element. You should slots
whenever you need full control over the content inside. For example, you may want to use the `label` slot on `rux-input`
to append an icon to the label.

On the other hand, if you only need a basic text label, you might want to just use the `label` attribute instead.
Some of our components offer both attributes and slots. In these scenarios, the attributes are less verbose and easier
to write.

**With attribute:**

```html
<rux-input type="text" label="First Name"></rux-input>
```

**With slot:**

```html
<rux-input type="text">
    <span slot="label">First name</span>
</rux-input>
```

These two examples render the same output, but the first is significantly less work.

### Methods

Methods are public functions of a component. They are commonly used to execute tasks or operations, for example, programatically setting a tree node to expand. All of our public methods are asynchronous and return a promise, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to perform additional actions after execution.

### Events

Like normal [Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events), Astro custom events are fired when a user interacts with an element.

### CSS Custom Properties

Some components may have CSS Custom Properties defined as part of their styling API. These are variables that you can set externally that will reflect inside the Shadow DOM.
CSS Custom Properties are a lot like SASS variables, with one significant difference--they can be swapped at run time and do not require any build process.
These CSS Custom Properties will usually be mapped to some CSS property (color, font-size, border-radius, etc).

For example, Card has a `--body-padding` CSS Custom Property for controlling the body padding.

### CSS Shadow Parts

> CAUTION: In most cases, overriding Astro's default styling will eject your application from the design system. If a component isn't flexible enough for your needs, consider submitting a feature request instead.

Because defining CSS Custom Properties for every possible CSS property is incredibly verbose and cumbersome, the recommended way for styling components is
to make use of [CSS Shadow Parts](https://css-tricks.com/styling-in-the-shadow-dom-with-css-shadow-parts/). CSS Shadow Parts give you full control over
the styling of a component's underlying Shadow DOM parts.

If a component has any available Shadow Parts, they will be documented under their API section.

> NOTE: We may change the internal CSS properties of elements that are exposed as Shadow Parts in minor releases.

To style a Shadow Part, use the \[::part`pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part).
For example, if you wanted a horizontal label, you could style the`form-field`and`label\` Shadow Parts:

```css
rux-input::part(form-field) {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
}
rux-input::part(label) {
    margin-right: 1rem;
}
```
