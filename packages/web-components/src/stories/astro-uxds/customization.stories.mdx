# Customization

If you're new to using Web Components, you'll quickly notice that the traditional way of styling elements with CSS doesn't work with Astro components.

For example, this won't work:

```html
<rux-button style="background:red;">button</rux-button>
```

This is a feature of the Shadow DOM--outside styles cannot be applied to content inside the Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM gives us a clean, native way
of encapsulating styles and protects your applications from breaking changes. Luckily, the Shadow DOM API provides two solutions
to this problem: CSS Custom Properties and CSS Shadow Parts.

## Using CSS Custom Properties

Some components may have CSS Custom Properties defined as part of their styling API. These are variables that you can set externally that will reflect inside the Shadow DOM.
CSS Custom Properties are a lot like SASS variables, with one significant difference--they can be swapped at run time and do not require any build process.
These CSS Custom Properties will usually be mapped to some CSS property (color, font-size, border-radius, etc).

## Using CSS Shadow Parts

> CAUTION: In most cases, overriding Astro's default styling will eject your application from the design system. If a component isn't flexible enough for your needs, consider submitting a feature request instead. 

Because defining CSS Custom Properties for every possible CSS property is incredibly verbose and cumbersome, the recommended way for styling components is
to make use of [CSS Shadow Parts](https://css-tricks.com/styling-in-the-shadow-dom-with-css-shadow-parts/). CSS Shadow Parts give you full control over
the styling of a component's underlying Shadow DOM parts.

If a component has any available Shadow Parts, they will be documented under their API section.

> NOTE: We may change the internal CSS properties of elements that are exposed as Shadow Parts in minor releases. 

To style a Shadow Part, use the [::part` pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part).
For example, if you wanted a horizontal label, you could style the `form-field` and `label` Shadow Parts:

```css
rux-input::part(form-field) {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
}
rux-input::part(label) {
    margin-right: 1rem;
}
```
