# Slider

A Slider allows users to choose from a range of continuous and discrete values. The Slider displays the range of possible values and the Sliderâ€™s indicator displays the current value.

## Guidelines

* [Astro UXDS: Slider](https://www.astrouxds.com/components/slider/)

<Canvas of={SliderStories.Default} />

## API

<Controls />

## Variants

### Disabled

<Canvas of={SliderStories.Disabled} />

### With Help Text

<Canvas of={SliderStories.WithHelpText} />

### With Error Text

<Canvas of={SliderStories.WithErrorText} />

### With Axis Labels

<Canvas of={SliderStories.WithAxisLabels} />

To display tick marks and labels, make use of the `axis-labels` attribute. This accepts an array of strings that will
be evenly distributed across the progress bar.

#### Ticks Only

If you only want to show tick marks without labels, make use of the `ticks-only` attribute. NOTE: you will still need to pass in the array of strings to determine how many
ticks to show.

### Dual Range

Adding the `min-val` attribute to the slider will add a second thumb, creating a dual-range slider.

<Canvas of={SliderStories.DualRange} />

#### Strict

By default, the dual-range slider can have it's thumbs go anywhere, including past each other. If you'd rather the thumbs not be able to swap,
you can use the `strict` property to prevent it.

### Horizontal Labels

You can utilize the `form-field` and `label` Shadow Parts to have full control over label placement. For example:

```css
rux-slider::part(form-field) {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
}
rux-slider::part(label) {
    margin-right: var(--spacing-2);
}
```
<Canvas of={SliderStories.HorizontalLabel} />

## Cherry Picking

If you're already utilizing a build system that supports tree shaking and want to only import this individual component:

```js
import { RuxSlider } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-slider.js'
customElements.define('rux-slider', RuxSlider)
```
