# Timeline <BetaTag>BETA</BetaTag>

Timeline displays a sequence of realtime events during a fixed time span. The Playhead indicates the current time of day. Time Regions represent events.

  <p class="banner-text">
    Timeline is currently experimental which means that we may introduce breaking changes at any time.
    These will not be reflected in our current semver versioning and release strategy.

## API

<Controls />

## Timeline

The Timeline component is responsible for

* creating and manipulating the grid used to display events.
* rendering the appropriate labels for **Ruler**
* controlling the position of the playhead

It is composed of the following subcomponents:

* Track
* Time Region
* Ruler

### Date Formats and Timezones

When passing in a date to either the timeline, playhead, or time regions, you must specify a time and timezone in your date string, otherwise it will default to the local user's timezone.
For example: If you wanted to show "2021-01-01" in UTC, you would pass in `2021-01-01**T00:00:00Z**`.

### Zoom

The width between each time interval can be controlled by the `zoom` property. By default, it starts at 1 and can be incremented.
The column width is automatically calculated based off of the timeline's current interval (days/hours/etc).
You should consider your timeline's range and set an appropriate default zoom level so that your time intervals can fill the entire viewport.

If your timeline spans multiple days, you will also want to consider manually controlling the interval. For example, if your timeline is set to days,
you will probably want your interval to change to hours as your zoom level increases.

### Setting the Time Regions

To add any number of Time Regions, you can simply add them as children to any Track element:

```
<rux-track>
    <div slot="label">
        Region1
    </div>
    <rux-time-region
        start="2021-02-01T00:00:00Z"
        end="2021-02-01T00:30:00Z"
    >
        Region1
    </rux-time-region>
    <rux-time-region
        start="2021-02-01T03:00:00Z"
        end="2021-02-01T05:30:00Z"
    >
        Region2
    </rux-time-region>
</rux-track>
```

### Enabling the Ruler

To enable the bottom ruler, make use of the `ruler` slot by passing in a `rux-ruler` within a `rux-track`:

```
<rux-track slot="ruler">
  <rux-ruler></rux-ruler>
</rux-track>
```

### Enabling Vertical Scrolling

If your Timeline contains too many rows to fit into your viewport, you can make use of the `time-region-container` CSS Shadow Part and set a height using CSS.
This will enable the overflow: scroll.

For example:

```
rux-timeline::part(time-region-container) {
    height: 223px;
}
```

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.WithVerticalScroll} />

<Story of={TimelineStories.Track} />

## Track

Tracks are responsible for displaying content in horizontal lanes across the Timeline.
They can include **Time Regions** or the **Ruler** component.
They are composed of a label section and a time region section.


### Setting the Label

To set the label of a Region, you can use the `label` slot:

```
<rux-track>
    <div slot="label">
        Region1
    </div>
</rux-track>
```

## Time Region

Time Regions represent single events in time. A `start` time and an `end` time are required. If a `start` and `end` time aren't provided, or an invalid range is provided,
the component will throw an error and not render.

```
<rux-time-region
    start="2021-02-01T00:00:00Z"
    end="2021-02-01T00:30:00Z"
>
    Region1
</rux-time-region>
```

### Partial Time Regions

If a Time Region's start and end date falls outside of the range of the Timeline, a Time Region will be display visually as a Partial Time Region.


## Ruler

**Ruler** is responsible for displaying the intervals of time across the timeline grid. If the Timeline `interval` is set to `hour`, the start of a new day is indicated by the date displayed underneath the time, and the background color is changed.

```
    <rux-ruler></rux-ruler>
```

## Sub Tracks

Timeline supports the ability to add SubTracks. These can then be collapsed/expanded with a minimal amount of additional script. Here is an example using basic HTML/JS.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.SubTracks} />

**In these examples we:**

1. Include all of the `rux-time-region` in the main track when the subtracks are collapsed.
2. Break the `rux-time-region` out into the appropriate sub-tracks when they are expanded, and remove them from the main track.
3. (Optional) For visual differentiation between a main track and a sub track, add a class like `sub-track` to each sub-track and then add the following css:

```css
  .sub-track,
  .sub-track::part(container),
  .sub-track::part(track-header) {
    background-color: var(--color-background-surface-header);
  }
  .sub-track [slot="label"] {
    padding-inline-start: 2rem;
  }
```

* [React Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/timeline-demo-collapse-react-z5cq3m?file=/src/App.js)
* [Angular Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/timeline-demo-collapse-angular-vic3fn?file=/src/app/app.component.html)

## With Played Indicator

Timeline tracks can optionally show a "played" visual state to indicate past time relative to the current playhead. To show this state, use the `has-played-indicator` attribute on your RuxTimeline.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.WithPlayedIndicator} />

## Show Start of Day

<StyledDiv>
  <div>Warning: <span class="custom-code">`show-start-of-day`</span> is deprecated.</div>

  <p class="banner-text">
    Instead, use the `show-secondary-ruler` prop on the rux-timeline. This will display the start of the intervals.
  </p>
</StyledDiv>

When using the 'hour' interval spanning multiple days, it can be difficult to determine when a given day has ended or started.
In this case, you can make use of the `show-start-of-day` attribute to display a visual indicator at 00:00.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.ShowStartOfDay} />

## Minutes

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.Minutes} />

## Months/Weeks

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.MonthsWeeks} />

## With Ruler Position

You can change the position of a timeline's ruler via the `ruler-position` prop. The valid positions are `top`, `bottom`, or `both`.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.RulerPosition} />

## With Secondary Ruler

You can enable a secondary ruler to show the start of each interval. Showing the Julian Day next to the start of the interval is the default behavior. To remove this, add the `hide-j-day` prop on the timeline.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.ShowSecondaryRuler} />

## With Grid

You can enable a grid to show the start of each interval. To do this, add the `show-grid` prop on the timeline.

<Canvas of={TimelineStories.ShowGrid} />

## Cherry Picking

If you're already utilizing a build system that supports tree shaking and want to only import this individual component:

```js
import { RuxTimeline } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-timeline'
import { RuxTrack } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-track'
import { RuxTimeRegion } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-time-region'
import { RuxRuler } from '@astrouxds/astro-web-components/dist/components/rux-ruler'
customElements.define('rux-timeline', RuxTimeline)
customElements.define('rux-track', RuxTrack)
customElements.define('rux-time-region', RuxTimeRegion)
customElements.define('rux-ruler', RuxRuler)
```
